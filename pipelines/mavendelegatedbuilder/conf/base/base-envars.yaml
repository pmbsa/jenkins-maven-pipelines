envvars:
# these represent different types of branches as classified by
# the gitWorkFlow variable set in each job, we can then set different
# executions depending on that classification.
# "other" is simply a catch all that dont match the specific branch type or your need
## Enhanced configuration##
# A basic shell command may be used to set a value instead of a literal
# the format of the YAML value to execute the command is as follows
#   1: literal 'sh' followed by the : delimiter
#   2: the container you wish to run the command in followed by : delimiter
#   3: the command you wish to run.
# e.g. sh:mavenbuilder:echo 'help me please' (will run echo command on the container marked 'mavenbuilder')
